# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## Additional Libraries

This project includes additional libraries to enhance development and functionality:

- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.
- **React Router DOM**: For managing routing within the application.
- **SweetAlert2**: For creating elegant alert popups and modals.
- **Flowbite React**: For using pre-built UI components based on Tailwind CSS.
- **js-Cookie**: Used to manage cookies in the browser, such as storing, reading, and deleting data easily.

## React Hooks Used

This project leverages the following React Hooks:

- **useState**: For managing state within functional components.
- **useEffect**: For performing side effects in functional components.
- **useNavigate** (from React Router DOM): For programmatically navigating between routes.
- **useLocation** (from React Router DOM): For accessing the current route information.

These hooks provide powerful tools for managing state, navigation, and side effects, making the development process more efficient and seamless.
